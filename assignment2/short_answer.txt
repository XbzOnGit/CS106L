Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)  
Names: XbzOnGit  
1. at() vs []  
at will throw an exception if the key is not found, while [] will do auto-insertion.  
We need a const version of at(), and it can be used in other const functions.  
But due to its semantics, it is impossible to have a const version of [].  
2. .find vs std::find
.find in hashmap is on average O(1), while std::find is a linear search which is on average O(n).  
3. RAII  
This HashMap class is RAII-compliant.  
Looking into ins constructors, you can find that all its resources are acquired inside to be in valid state.  
In destructor, it also clears all its contents(with my fix).  
4. operator++  
prefix++ is implemented by increasing itself first, and if it reaches nullptr, it will try to find the next
bucket with elements.  
suffix++ is implemented by making a copy and then use prefix++, then return the copy.  
Note that suffix++ only return iterator copy, while prefix++ returns a reference to itself.  
It assumes that the iterator is correct and not .end(), no check on .end() is made.  
It will cause UB.
